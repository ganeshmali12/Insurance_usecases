## Projects Overview
# 1.Insurance Quote Comparison Chatbot

An AI-powered chatbot that compares multiple insurance quotes and explains differences in premium, deductible, and coverage in simple language.

# Key Highlights:

Supports JSON and plain-text insurance quotes

Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Scenario-based reasoning (e.g., family of 4)

Flask-based interactive UI

Hugging Face MiniLM embeddings (free & local)

Folder: Quote_Comparison_Chatbot/

# 2️.Claims Description Normalizer

An NLP-based system that converts unstructured insurance claim descriptions into clean, structured JSON data.

Key Highlights:

Converts messy claim text into structured format

Entity extraction using LLMs

Prompt-based normalization

Useful for downstream automation and analytics

Folder: Claims_Description_Normalizer/

# 3️.Underwriting Assistant

An AI assistant designed to support insurance underwriting decisions by analyzing applicant details against predefined underwriting rules.

Key Highlights:

Rule-based + LLM reasoning

Explains underwriting decisions clearly

Uses structured rulebooks

Suitable for decision-support systems

Folder: Underwriting_Assistant/
