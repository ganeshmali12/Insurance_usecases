##  Projects Overview
### 1️. Insurance Quote Comparison Chatbot

An AI-powered chatbot that compares multiple insurance quotes and explains differences in premium, deductible, and coverage in simple language.

Key Highlights:

- Supports JSON and plain-text insurance quotes

- Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

- Scenario-based reasoning (e.g., family size, coverage needs)

- Flask-based interactive UI

- Hugging Face MiniLM embeddings (free & local)

Folder: Quote_Comparison_Chatbot/

---

### 2️. Claims Description Normalizer

An NLP-based system that converts unstructured insurance claim descriptions into clean, structured JSON data.

Key Highlights:

- Converts messy claim text into structured format

- Entity extraction using LLMs

- Prompt-based normalization

- Useful for automation and analytics

Folder: Claims_Description_Normalizer/

---

### 3️. Underwriting Assistant

An AI assistant designed to support insurance underwriting decisions by evaluating applicant details against predefined rules.

Key Highlights:
~~~
- Rule-based + LLM reasoning

- Transparent and explainable decisions

- Uses structured underwriting rulebooks

- Suitable for decision-support systems

Folder: Underwriting_Assistant/

### 4️. Document Classification Agent

An AI-powered system that classifies insurance documents such as Claim Forms, Inspection Reports, and Invoices using OCR, rules, and Azure OpenAI.

The system safely returns Unknown for irrelevant documents instead of forcing incorrect classifications.

Key Highlights:

- Supports images and PDFs

- Free OCR using Tesseract

- Insurance-domain validation and rejection logic

- Semantic document understanding using Azure OpenAI

- Confidence score with explanation

- Clean Flask-based UI

Folder: Document_Classification_Agent/
