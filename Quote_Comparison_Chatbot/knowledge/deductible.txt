Deductible means the amount of money you must pay yourself before the insurance company starts paying.

Example:
If your deductible is ₹2,000 and your hospital bill is ₹20,000,
you pay ₹2,000 and the insurance company pays the rest.

Lower deductible:
- You pay less from your pocket during a claim
- Premium is usually higher
- Better if hospital visits are frequent

Higher deductible:
- Premium is cheaper
- You pay more during claims
- Risky for families or frequent treatment
