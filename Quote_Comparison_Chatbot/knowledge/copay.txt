Co-pay means a fixed percentage of the medical bill that you must pay yourself, even after insurance is applied.

Example:
If the co-pay is 10% and the hospital bill is ₹50,000,
you must pay ₹5,000 and the insurance company pays the rest.

Lower co-pay:
- Better for frequent hospital visits
- Lower out-of-pocket expense
- Premium may be higher

Higher co-pay:
- Premium is cheaper
- You pay more during claims
- Not ideal for families or elderly members
