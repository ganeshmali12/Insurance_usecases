Room rent limit means the maximum cost per day for a hospital room that the insurance company will cover.

Example:
If a policy allows room rent up to ₹5,000 per day and you choose a room costing ₹7,000 per day,
you must pay the extra ₹2,000 yourself.

No room rent limit:
- You can choose any room
- Fewer surprise expenses
- Usually comes with a higher premium

Room rent limit:
- Premium may be lower
- You may have to pay extra during hospitalization
- Important to check for families and emergencies
